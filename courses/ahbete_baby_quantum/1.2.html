<body><h1 id='12-the-photoelectric-effect'>1.2 The Photoelectric Effect</h1>
    <p>The <strong>photoelectric effect</strong> refers to the phenomenon of light producing a flow of electricity upon a metal surface.
    The effect was first demonstrated by Heinrich Hertz in the 1880s. It is not well-explained until Albert Einstein proposed an explanation in 1905.</p>

    <li><strong>Bremsstrahlung</strong>: &quot;braking radiation&quot;.</li>
    <li><strong>Cutoff wavelength</strong>: minimum wavelength possible.
    When producing X-rays, electrons are accelerated, smashed onto a target, and rapidly slow down. As it undergoes a large acceleration, powerful electromagnetic waves are created. Since electromagnetic waves can be quantized, maximum energy (similarly maximum frequency or minimum wavelength) of produced X-rays can be calculated based on the maximum kinetic energy of electrons (See problem 4 for detail).</li>

    <ol start='' >
    <li>As a review for 1.1, What is the peak wavelength for black body radiation due to the human body?
    (Hint: Using Wein&#39;s law)</li>
    <li>(Harris) Light of 300 nm wavelength strikes a metal plate, and photoelectrons are produced with a speed of 0.002c.
    (a) What is the work function of the metal?
    (b) What is the threshold wavelength then?</li>
    <li>(Harris) A 940 kHz radio station broadcasts 40 kW power. How many photons are transmitted per second?</li>
    <li>(Harris) A television picture tube accelerates electrons through a potential difference of 30,000 V. Find the cut-off wavelength for X-ray produced.
    (There is protection mechanisms shielding the X-ray. Also, this type of television is not that common nowadays.)</li>
