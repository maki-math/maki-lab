<body><h1>2.2 The Matter Wave</h1>
<h2>2.2.1 Wavelength</h2>
<p>In 1924, Louis de Broglie hypothesized the matter wave. The wavelength associated with a massive object is given by</p>
<div>$$
\bbox[silver]{\lambda=\frac{h}{p}.}
$$</div>
<p>This relationship is true in general, even for relativistic cases. This contribution won for de Broglie the 1929 Nobel Prize.</p>
<h2>2.2.2 Frequency</h2>
<p>The frequency of a matter wave follow the same relationship as for electromagnetic radiation</p>
<div>$$
\bbox[silver]{f=\frac{E}{h}.}
$$</div>
<p>Recall that the wave number (or wave vector, which can be understand as &quot;spatial frequency&quot;) and angular frequency are defined as $k=2\pi/\lambda$ and $\omega=2\pi/T$  respectively, it would be convenient to define</p>
<div>$$
\bbox[silver]{\hbar=\frac{h}{2\pi}\approx1.055\times10^{-34}J\cdot s.}
$$</div>
<p>Then the wave-particle properties can be linked via</p>
<div>$$
\bbox[silver]{p=\frac{h}{\lambda}=\hbar k,}
$$</div>
<div>$$
\bbox[silver]{E=hf=\hbar\omega.}
$$</div>
<p>Again, these two relations are true in general.</p>
<h2>2.2.3 Velocity</h2>
<p>The relation $v=f\lambda$ can be directly applied to find the speed of matter wave</p>
<div>$$
v_{phase}=f\lambda=\frac{E}{h}\frac{h}{p}=\frac{E}{p}.
$$</div>
<p> However, we should notice that this is the velocity of the wave, or the phase velocity. The velocity of the particle, or the group velocity can be found using energy and momentum.</p>

<h1>Practice Problems for 2.2</h1>
<ol start='' >
<li><p>(Harris) A Bragg diffraction experiment is conducted using a beam of electrons accelerated through a 1.0 kV potential difference.</p>
<p>(a) If the spacing between atomic planes in the crystal is 0.1 nm. at what angles with respect to the planes will diffraction maxima be observed? </p>
<p>(b) If a beam of X-rays produces diffraction maxima at the same angles as the electron beam. what is the X-ray photon energy?</p>
</li>
<li><p>(Harris) Classically and nonrelativistically, we say that the energy $E$ of a massive free particle is just its kinetic energy. </p>
<p>(a) With this assumption, show that the classical particle velocity $v_{particle}$ is $2E/p$. </p>
<p>(b) Show that this velocity and that of the matter wave differ by a factor of 2. </p>
<p>(c) In reality, a massive object also has internal energy no matter how slowly it moves, and its total energy $E$ is $\gamma mc^2$, where $\gamma\equiv1/\sqrt{1-(v_{particle}/c)^2}$. Show that $v_{particle}$ is $pc^2/E$ and that $v_{wave}$ is $c^2/v_{particle}$. Is there anything wrong with $v_{wave}$ ?</p>
