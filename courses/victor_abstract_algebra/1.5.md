### 1.5 Normal Subgroup and Quotient Group

#### Normal Subgroup

**Definition 1.5.1** Normal subgroup, $N\lhd G$.

​    If $N$ is a subgroup of $G$, and also satisfied
$$
\forall g\in G, gA=Ag
$$
then we called $N$ is a normal subgroup of $G$, which is denoted by $N\lhd G$.

**Ex 1.5.1** All subgroup of an Abelian group is a normal subgroup.

**Theorem 1.5.2** 'a subgroup which order is **two**'
    $N$ is a subgroup of $G$. If the order of $N$ equals to two, then $N$ is a normal subgroup.

**Theorem 1.5.3** some properties of normal subgroup
    Assume $N$ is a subgroup of $G$, then TFAE:
    (1) $N\lhd G$
    (2) $\forall g\in G, gNg^{-1}=N$ (i.e. $N$ is conjugate with itself.)
    (3) $\forall g\in G, gNg^{-1}\subset N$
    (4) $N_G(N)=G$
    (5) every left coset of $N$ is right coset.

**Ex 1.5.2** [!] let $G=\{(a,b)|a\in\mathbb{R}_*,b\in\mathbb{R}\}$, define 'multiplication'
$$
(a,b)(c,d)=(ac,ad+b)
$$
Let $K=\{(1,b)|b\in\mathbb{R}\}$. Try to prove that: $K\lhd G$.

**Ex 1.5.3** Let $N < M < G$.
​    (1) Try to prove that: if $N\lhd G$, then $N\lhd M$.
​    (2) If $N\lhd M$, then do we have the conclusion: $N\lhd G$?

**Ex 1.5.4** [*,!] Let $M,N$ are normal subgroups of $G$, if $M\cap N={e}$, then prove that for all $m\in M$ and $n\in N$, $mn=nm$.

#### Quotient group

**Theorem 1.5.4** 'well-defined' of multiplication of cosets
    Assume $N$ is a normal subgroup of group $G$. $a,a',b$ are in $G$. If cosets $Na$ equals to $Na'$, then $N(ab)=N(a'b)$.

**Definition 1.5.5** the quotient/ factor group, $G/N$
    If $N$ is a **normal** subgroup of group $G$, then all cosets of $N$ form a group, which we called it the quotient group, $G/N$ (read $G$ **modulo** $N$, or simply $G$ mod $N$).
    The element in $G/N$, $gN$ or $Ng$, we usually write it as $\bar g$ without confusion.

**Theorem 1.5.6** the order of the quotient group
    If $N$ is a normal subgroup of group $G$, then the order of $G/N$ equals to $|G|/|N|$. [**Ex 1.5.5**]
