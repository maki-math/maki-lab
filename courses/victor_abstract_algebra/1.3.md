### 1.3 Subgroups and Cosets

#### Subgroups

**Ex 1.3.1** The even number set $2\Z=\{2n|\ n\in\Z\}$ with addition is a group.

**Definition 1.3.1** Subgroups, $H\leqslant G$.
    Let $(G,\cdot)$ is a group, if $H$ is the subset of $G$, and $(H,\cdot)$ is also the group (with the same operation), then we say $(H,+)$ is a **subgroup** of $(G,+)$. This relationship is denote by $H\leqslant G$.
​    Furthermore, if we also have $H\neq G$, then we say $(H,+)$ is a **proper subgroup** of $(G,+)$, and denoted by $H<G$.

**Notation 1.3.2** 'operation between sets and elements'
    Let $(G,\cdot)$ is a group, $A,B$ are subgroups of $G$, $g\in G$, and we define
$$
\begin{align}
AB     &= \{ab|\ a\in A,b\in B\}\\
gA     &= \{ga|\ a\in A\}\\
Ag     &= \{ag|\ a\in A\}\\
A^{-1} &= \{a^{-1}|\ a\in A\}
\end{align}
$$

**Ex 1.3.2** we have such a relation
$$
(\Z,+) < (\Q,+) < (\R,+) < (\C,+) \\
(\Q_*,\cdot) < (\R_*,\cdot) < (\C_*,\cdot)
$$

**Ex 1.3.3** like the beginning of this section, we have for all $n\in \Z_{\geqslant 2}$
$$
n\Z < \Z
$$
**Theorem 1.3.3** The Subgroup Criterion
    A subset $H$ of a group $G$ is a subgroup iff.
    (1) $H$ is not empty
    (2) For all $x,y\in H$, $xy^{-1}\in H$.

**Corollary 1.3.4**  'multiply own inverse'
    A subset $H$ of a group $G$ is a subgroup iff.
    (1) $H$ is not empty
    (2) $HH^{-1}=H$. (or $H^{-1}H=H$)

**Ex 1.3.3** A subset $H$ of a group $G$ satisfied
​    (1) $H$ is not empty
​    (2) for all $x,y\in H$, $xy\in H$.
​    Is $H$ a subgroup of $G$? Why?

**Theorem 1.3.5** The Intersection of Subgroups
    (1) If $H$ and $K$ are subgroups of $G$, then so is their intersection $H\cap K$.
    (2) The intersection of an **arbitrary** nonempty collection of subgroups of $G$ is again a subgroup of $G$. [**Ex 1.3.4**]
    Hint: notice that if $x\in H\cap K$, then $x\in H$ **and** $x\in K$.

**Ex 1.3.5** [*] If $H$ and $K$ are subgroups of $G$, then $HK$ is a subgroup of $G$ if and only if (.iff) $HK=KH$.

#### Cosets

**Definition 1.3.6** Left Cosets, $aH$.
    For a group $G$, if $H$ is a subgroup of $G$ and $g\in G$, we called $gH$ is a **left coset** of $H$ in $G$.
    Similarly, $Hg$ is called a **right coset** of $H$ in $G$.

**Definition 1.3.7** order of a set, $|A|$.
    The order of a set $A$ is **the number** of elements in $A$, and is denoted by $|A|$.
    In particular, if $A$ is infinite, we say $|A|=\infty$.

**Property 1.3.8** the order of coset
    If $H$ is a subgroup of group $G$, $g\in G$, then $|Hg|=|H|$.

**Property 1.3.9** a specific cosets is a group
    If $H$ is a subgroup of group $G$, $g\in G$, then the following are equivalent (TFAE):
    (1) $g\in H$
    (2) $Hg=H$.
    (3) The right coset $Hg$ is a group.

**Property 1.3.10** 'The one is all!'
    If $H$ is a subgroup of $G$, $x,y\in G$, and the intersection $Hx\cap Hy$ is not empty, then $Hx=Hy$.

**Property 1.3.11** the equivalence relation with respect to cosets
    If $H$ is a subgroup of $G$, then define relation '$\sim$' on set $G$: for $x,y\in G$, 
$$
x\sim y \iff xy^{-1} \in H
$$

**Theorem 1.3.12** Lagrange's Theorem
    If $H$ is a subgroup of group $G$, then 
$$
|G| = |H|[G:H]
$$
​    The number of distinct right cosets of $H$ in $G$, which we called the **index** of $H$ with respect to $G$, is express as $[G:H]$.

**Ex 1.3.6** 
​    (1). If G is a group and $H\leqslant G$, then all left cosets of $H$ can also form a partition of $G$.
​    (2). [*] If G is a group, $H\leqslant G$, and $G$ has a partition consisted of right cosets
$$
G = \bigcup_{g\in R} Hg
$$
then
$$
G = \bigcup_{g\in R} g^{-1}H
$$
is also a partition of $G$. 
​    Hint: partition: disjoint+union

#### The Application of cosets

**Theorem 1.3.13** 'the order of the multiplication of subgroups'
    Let $G$ is a finite group, $H,K\leqslant G$, then
$$
|HK| = \frac{|H||K|}{|H\cap K|}
$$

**Ex 1.3.7** [*,!] If $G$ is a finite group, $H,K\leqslant G$, then for $g\in G$
$$
|HgK| = |H|[K:g^{-1}Hg\cap K]
$$
​    Hint: try to copy the proof of theorem **1.3.13**.
