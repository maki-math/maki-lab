### 1.4 Normalizer and Centralizer

#### Cosets equals to cosets

#### Conjugate relation between two subsets

**Definition 1.4.1** conjugation, $g^{-1}Ag$ or $g^{-1}ag$
    For a **subset** $A$ of a group $G$ and $g\in G$, define $B=g^{-1}Ag$ is a conjugate subset of $A$.
    In particular, for an **element** $a$ of a group $G$ and $g\in G$, define $b=g^{-1}ag$ is a conjugate element of $a$.

**Ex 1.4.1** If $H\leqslant G$, then $K=g^{-1}Hg$ is also a subgroup of $G$.

**Theorem 1.4.2** the conjugate relation
    Define such a relation between **subsets** of the group $G$: for $A,B\subset G$
$$
A\sim B \iff \exist g\in G, B = g^{-1}Ag
$$
then it is an equivalence relation.

**Ex 1.4.2** For any $g\in G$, the order of subset $A$ is equal to its conjugate subset $g^{-1}Ag$.

#### Normalizer and Centralizer

**Definition 1.4.3** Normalizer, $N_G(A)$
    For a subset $A$ of a group $G$, define the normalizer of $A$:
$$
N_G(A) = \{g\in G|\ g^{-1}Ag=A\}
$$
which means the collection of all **elements in $G$** that make $A$ be self-conjugate.

**Ex 1.4.3** If $G$ is an Abelian group, then for arbitrary subset $A$ of $G$, we have $N_G(A)=G$. 

**Theorem 1.4.4** the normalizer is a subgroup.
    For arbitrary **subset** $A$ of $G$, the normalizer of $A$ is a subgroup of $G$.

**Theorem 1.4.5** the number of conjugate subsets
    If $A$ is a subset of group $G$, then the number of conjugate subsets of $A$ is equal to the **index** of it's normalizer, i.e. $[G:N_G(A)]$.

**Ex 1.4.4** In group $S_3$, let $A=$
$$
\left\{
\begin{pmatrix}
1 & 2 & 3\\
2 & 3 & 1
\end{pmatrix},
\begin{pmatrix}
1 & 2 & 3\\
3 & 1 & 2
\end{pmatrix}
\right\}
$$
Then prove that 
$$
g=\begin{pmatrix}
1 & 2\\
2 & 1
\end{pmatrix} \in N_G(A)
$$
but for all $a\in A$, $ag\neq ga$.

**Definition 1.4.6** Centralizer, $C_G(A)$
    For a subset $A$ of a group $G$, define the centralizer of $A$:
$$
C_G(A) = \{g\in G|\ g^{-1}ag=a, \forall a\in A\}
$$
which means the collection of all **elements in $G$** that make all **elements in** $A$ be self-conjugate.

â€‹    In particular, we called an element $g$ of $G$ the **central element** of $G$ if $g\in C_G(G)$, and $C_G(G)$ the **center** of $G$ (denoted by $C(G)$ or $Z(G)$).

**Ex 1.4.5** If $G$ is an Abelian group, then for arbitrary subset $A$ of $G$, we have $C_G(A)=G$ and $C(G)=G$.

**Ex 1.4.6** In group $S_3$, let $A=$
$$
\left\{
\begin{pmatrix}
1 & 2 & 3\\
2 & 3 & 1
\end{pmatrix},
\begin{pmatrix}
1 & 2 & 3\\
3 & 1 & 2
\end{pmatrix}
\right\}
$$
Then prove that 
$$
C_G(A) = \left\{
\begin{pmatrix}
1 & 2 & 3\\
1 & 2 & 3
\end{pmatrix},
\begin{pmatrix}
1 & 2 & 3\\
2 & 3 & 1
\end{pmatrix},
\begin{pmatrix}
1 & 2 & 3\\
3 & 1 & 2
\end{pmatrix}
\right\}
$$
**Theorem 1.4.7** the centralizer is a subgroup.
    For arbitrary **subset** $A$ of $G$, the centralizer of $A$ is a subgroup of $G$. Thus the centralizer of $A$ is also a subgroup of the normalizer of $A$. [**Ex 1.4.7**]

**Theorem 1.4.8** the number of conjugate elements
    If $a$ is an element of group $G$, then the number of conjugate subsets of $a$ is equal to the **index** of it's centralizer, i.e. $[G:C_G(a)]$. [**Ex 1.4.8**]
